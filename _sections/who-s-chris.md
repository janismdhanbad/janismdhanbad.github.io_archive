Hello all, this is Janpreet. I like working with data and extracting meaningful insights from it. From past two years I have been working as a data scientist at Atkins. 
Majority of my work involves Computer Vision tasks like Object detection, Instance segmentation and Object tracking. I have worked with forward, aerial and geo-spatial Imagery.
My areas of interest for research are Continual AI, Domain adaptation, Catastrophic forgetting and video analytics. Please feel free to reach out.
