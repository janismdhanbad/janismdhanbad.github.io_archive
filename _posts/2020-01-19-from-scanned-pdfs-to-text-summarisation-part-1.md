I worked on text data a couple of months ago during which I learnt quite a lot about the core NLP tasks like topic modelling, entity extraction, text summarization and POS tagging.
Iâ€™d be starting this discussion about my learning experience from the basics. The basic outline of the discussion would be:
Extracting text from unstructured documents(Scanned PDFs) [THIS ARTICLE]
Text cleaning and basic NLP tasks
Finding Named entities, POS tagging
Finding the topics associated with the document
Summarisation of the documents and
Finding similar documents
