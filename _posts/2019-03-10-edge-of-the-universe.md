What do you think after you see this picture? Probably nothing. Some millennials might think that it is a picture of Camera's Negative film but most of you won't be able to figure out the real importance of this image.

This image portrays our existance. Everyone we know, everyone we have known, heard or read about. This picture is taken by Voyager-1 Spaceprobe. The spacecraft acquired a total of 60 frames for a mosaic of the solar system from a distance of more than 4 billion miles from Earth and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. This blown-up image of the Earth was taken through three color filters — violet, blue and green — and recombined to produce the color image. The background features in the image are artifacts resulting from the magnification.
