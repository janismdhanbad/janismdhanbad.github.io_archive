* Worked on instance segmentation of RGB-D images

### Text Classification and Similarity
* Worked on Kaggle Quora Question similarity problem statement
* Worked on similar asset name clustering using word2vec on asset names followed by Kmeans on these vectors 

-----------------

## Geo-spatial data Analysis

### Land use change
* Worked on differencing DEMs between two years using virtual rasters to find elevations and depressions in the land
* Exctracted DSMs, DTMs from LiDAR data using PDAL


-----------------

## Machine Learning at scale

### Worked on Databricks using Pyspark to Deploy Deep learning models at scale
* Wrote PySpark code on databricks and deployed machine learning and deep learning models using user defined functions(UDF)


### Worked with AWS sagemaker to deploy deep learning models using Tensorflow-serving
* Used Tensorflow serving with Sagemaker to Deploy Mask-RCNN network

-----------------

## Other

### An active participant in Kaggle competitions

-----------------

## Online coursework:

### I spend hundreds of hours doing hands-on projects from online courses and books
